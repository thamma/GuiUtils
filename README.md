###What?
Those fancy menus at the top of your screen...

Everybody seems to use them these days. Yet they are a **pain in the arse to code**.

That's where MenuBuilder comes into play. MenuBuilder comes with an intuitive way to build those hierarchical menus.
All you need is some **fairy dust** here and there and you'll love MenuBuilder in no time!

	
###Wait, what? Fairy dust?

Let me give you an example:

Lets say you want to create one of those nested menus in which you literally can play hide and seek (of course in the code, too!). Maybe like this:

So your code would look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/jsYHEFJ.png). Lets not talk about having the **buttons do something**. My eyes are bleeding as I type this.

How about rather having something like this?

Now you simply have to swing your wand and you're good to go.
